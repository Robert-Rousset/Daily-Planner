# 05 Third-Party APIs

## Work Day Scheduler

This project was very hard for me to get started, I had to do a few itterations to make it work properly. At first I had designed the whole rows of content in HTML. I had got most of the functions working, as in the the changing of 'past' 'present' and 'future and had got the local storage saving the content.

After my initial solution, I decided to create all the elements in Javascript. This took a while to get used to but became easy as I could comment out the HTML and copy it into javascript and append/add class where necessary.
